# melt-test
Test HTML/CSS Assessment for MeltMedia

Due Monday, June 20th

/*=========================================*/

Here are the things to keep in mind: 

* Your breakout should be fully responsive, with break points where appropriate. 
* You don't need to be pixel perfect. Be creative! We won't penalize you for differing from the comp where it makes sense or where you think improvements should be made. As this test is responsive you'll likely have to make some choices about how the content should look at various screen sizes. Let's see what you come up with! 
* The code can be static, no need for a server.
* Please commit and push your code to a github repository by the deadline listed above. 


Optional: 
* Use a task runner such as grunt or gulp to serve up your breakout locally, with instructions on how to get it running.
